        <p class="sub" >Cultural Significance</p>
        <P>The embodiment of a ye olden aesthetic, Runish represents a synthesization of early English typefaces. 
          Its sharp thick edges, as if carved with a wood chisel, parallels that of the original Blackletter woodblocks 
          for the Gutenberg press. Its strict adherence to a hexagonal construction in the vein of Tunic's writing system
           for its runes, only to have a slew of exceptions very much akin to English's grammar. The little touches of idiosyncrasies
            within the characters themselves, like the upper case T's pronounced crossbar or the j's jagged edges, produces a unique and 
            distinguished quality akin to philosophy of Royal Romain (“The King's Font”). Runish, at the end of the day, ruminates on 
            English's clashing syncretic cultural history (hodge-podginess in English) and distills it into a functionable font. </P>

<!-- <P>The old ram stands looking down over rockslides, stupidly triumphant. I
  blink. I stare in horror. "Scat!" I hiss. "Go back to your cave, go back to your
  cowshed--whatever." He cocks his head like an elderly, slow-witted king,
  considers the angles, decides to ignore me. I stamp. I hammer the ground with
  my fists. I hurl a skull-size stone at him. He will not budge. I shake my two
  hairy fists at the sky and I let out a howl so unspeakable that the water at my feet
  turns sudden ice and even I myself am left uneasy. But the ram stays; the season
  is upon us. And so begins the twelfth year of my idiotic war. <br><br>
   The pain of it! The stupidity!<br><br>
   "Ah, well," I sigh, and shrug, trudge back to the trees.<br><br>
   Do not think my brains are squeezed shut, like the ram's, by the roots of
  horns. Flanks atremble, eyes like stones, he stares at as much of the world as he
  can see and feels it surging in him, filling his chest as the melting snow fills
  dried-out creekbeds, tickling his gross, lopsided balls and charging his brains
  with the same unrest that made him suffer last year at this time, and the year
  before, and the year before that. (He's forgotten them all.) His hindparts shiver
  with the usual joyful, mindless ache to mount whatever happens near--the storm
  piling up black towers to the west, some rotting, docile stump, some spraddlelegged ewe. I cannot bear to look. "Why can't these creatures discover a little
  dignity?" I ask the sky. The sky says nothing, predictably. I make a face, uplift a
  defiant middle finger, and give an obscene little kick. The sky ignores me,
  forever unimpressed. Him too I hate, the same as I hate these brainless budding
  trees, these brattling birds.<br><br>
   Not, of course, that I fool myself with thoughts that I'm more noble.
  Pointless, ridiculous monster crouched in the shadows, stinking of dead men,
  murdered children, martyred cows. (I am neither proud nor ashamed,
  understand. One more dull victim, leering at seasons that never were meant to be
  observed.) "Ah, sad one, poor old freak!" I cry, and hug myself, and laugh,
  letting out salt tears, he he! till I fall down gasping and sobbing. (It's mostly
  fake.) The sun spins mindlessly overhead, the shadows lengthen and shorten as
  if by plan. Small birds, with a high-pitched yelp, lay eggs. The tender grasses
  peek up, innocent yellow, through the ground: the children of the dead. (It was
  just here, this shocking green, that once when the moon was tombed in clouds, I
  tore off sly old Athelgard's head. Here, where the startling tiny jaws of crocuses
  snap at the late-winter sun like the heads of baby watersnakes, here I killed the
  old woman with the irongray hair. She tasted of urine and spleen, which made
  me spit. Sweet mulch for yellow blooms. Such are the tiresome memories of a
  shadow-shooter, earth-rim-roamer, walker of the world's weird wall.) "Waaah!" I
  cry, with another quick, nasty face at the sky, mournfully observing the way it is,
  bitterly remembering the way it was, and idiotically casting tomorrow's nets.
  "Aargh! Yaww!" I reel, smash trees. Disfigured son of lunatics. The big-boled
  oaks gaze down at me yellow with morning, beneath complexity. "No offense," I
  say, with a terrible, sycophantish smile, and tip an imaginary hat.<br><br>
   It was not always like this, of course. On occasion it's been worse.<br><br>
   No matter, no matter.<br><br>
   The doe in the clearing goes stiff at sight of my horridness, then remembers
  her legs and is gone. It makes me cross. "Blind prejudice!" I bawl at the
  splintered sunlight where half a second ago she stood. I wring my fingers, put on
  a long face. "Ah, the unfairness of everything," I say, and shake my head. It is a
  matter of fact that I have never killed a deer in all my life, and never will. Cows
  have more meat and, locked up in pens, are easier to catch. It is true, perhaps,
  that I feel some trifling dislike of deer, but no more dislike than I feel for other
  natural things--discounting men. But deer, like rabbits and bears and even men,
  can make, concerning my race, no delicate distinctions. That is their happiness:
  they see all life without observing it. They're buried in it like crabs in mud.
  Except men, of course. I am not in a mood, just yet, to talk of men.<br><br>
   So it goes with me day by day and age by age, I tell myself. Locked in the
  deadly progression of moon and stars. I shake my head, muttering darkly on
  shaded paths, holding conversation with the only friend and comfort this world
  affords, my shadow. Wild pigs clatter away through brush. A baby bird falls
  feet-up in my path, squeaking. With a crabby laugh, I let him lie, kind heaven's
  merciful bounty to some sick fox. So it goes with me, age by age. (Talking,
  talking. Spinning a web of words, pale walls of dreams, between myself and all I
  see.)<br><br>
   The first grim stirrings of springtime come (as I knew they must, having
  seen the ram), and even under the ground where I live, where no light breaks but
  the red of my fires and nothing stirs but the flickering shadows on my wet rock
  walls, or scampering rats on my piles of bones, or my mother's fat, foul bulk
  rolling over, restless again--molested by nightmares, old memories--I am aware
  in my chest of tuberstirrings in the blacksweet duff of the forest overhead. I feel
  my anger coming back, building up like invisible fire, and at last, when my soul
  can no longer resist, I go up--as mechanical as anything else--fists clenched
  against my lack of will, my belly growling, mindless as wind, for blood. I swim
  up through the firesnakes, hot dark whalecocks prowling the luminous green of
  the mere, and I surface with a gulp among churning waves and smoke. I crawl up
  onto the bank and catch my breath.<br><br>
   It's good at first to be out in the night, naked to the cold mechanics of the
  stars. Space hurls outward, falconswift, mounting like an irreversible injustice, a
  final disease. The cold night air is reality at last: indifferent to me as a stone
  face carved on a high cliff wall to show that the world is abandoned. So
  childhood too feels good at first, before one happens to notice the terrible
  sameness, age after age. I lie there resting in the steaming grass, the old lake
  hissing and gurgling behind me, whispering patterns of words my sanity resists.
  At last, heavy as an ice-capped mountain, I rise and work my way to the inner
  wall, beginning of wolfslopes, the edge of my realm. I stand in the high wind
  balanced, blackening the night with my stench, gazing down to cliffs that fall
  away to cliffs, and once again I am aware of my potential: I could die. I cackle
  with rage and suck in breath.<br><br>
   "Dark chasms!" I scream from the cliff-edge, "seize me! Seize me to your
  foul black bowels and crush my bones!" I am terrified at the sound of my own
  huge voice in the darkness. I stand there shaking from head to foot, moved to the
  deep-sea depths of my being, like a creature thrown into audience with thunder.
   At the same time, I am secretly unfooled. The uproar is only my own shriek,
  and chasms are, like all things vast, inanimate. They will not snatch me in a
  thousand years, unless, in a lunatic fit of religion, I jump.<br><br>
   I sigh, depressed, and grind my teeth. I toy with shouting some tidbit more--
  some terrifying, unthinkable threat, some blackly fuliginous riddling hex--but
  my heart's not in it. "Missed me!" I say with a coy little jerk and a leer, to keep
  my spirits up. Then, with a sigh, a kind of moan, I start very carefully down the
  cliffs that lead to the fens and moors and Hrothgar's hall. Owls cross my path as
  silently as raiding ships, and at the sound of my foot, lean wolves rise, glance at
  me awkwardly, and, neat of step as lizards, sneak away. I used to take some pride
  in that--the caution of owls when my shape looms in, the alarm I stir in these
  giant northern wolves. I was younger then. Still playing cat and mouse with the
  universe.<br><br>
   I move down through the darkness, burning with murderous lust, my brains
  raging at the sickness I can observe in myself as objectively as might a mind ten
  centuries away. Stars, spattered out through lifeless night from end to end, like
  jewels scattered in a dead king's grave, tease, torment my wits toward
  meaningful patterns that do not exist. I can see for miles from these rock walls:
  thick forest suddenly still at my coming--cowering stags, wolves, hedgehogs,
  boars, submerged in their stifling, unmemorable fear; mute birds, pulsating,
  thoughtless clay in hushed old trees, thick limbs interlocked to seal drab secrets
  in.<br><br>
   I sigh, sink into the silence, and cross it like wind. Behind my back, at the
  world's end, my pale slightly glowing fat mother sleeps on, old, sick at heart, in
  our dingy underground room. Life-bloated, baffled, long-suffering hag. Guilty,
  she imagines, of some unremembered, perhaps ancestral crime. (She must have
  some human in her.) Not that she thinks. Not that she dissects and ponders the
  dusty mechanical bits of her miserable life's curse. She clutches at me in her
  sleep as if to crush me. I break away. "Why are we here?" I used to ask her.
  "Why do we stand this putrid, stinking hole?" She trembles at my words. Her fat
  lips shake. "Don't ask!" her wiggling claws implore. (She never speaks.) "Don't
  ask!" It must be some terrible secret, I used to think. I'd give her a crafty squint.
  She'll tell me, in time, I thought. But she told me nothing. I waited on. That was
  before the old dragon, calm as winter, unveiled the truth. He was not a friend.<br><br>

   And so I come through trees and towns to the lights of Hrothgar's meadhall. I
  am no stranger here. A respected guest. Eleven years now and going on twelve I
  have come up this clean-mown central hill, dark shadow out of the woods below,
  and have knocked politely on the high oak door, bursting its hinges and sending
  the shock of my greeting inward like a cold blast out of a cave. "Grendel!" they
  squeak, and I smile like exploding spring. The old Shaper, a man I cannot help
  but admire, goes out the back window with his harp at a single bound, though
  blind as a bat. The drunkest of Hrothgar's thanes come reeling and clanking
  down from their wall-hung beds, all shouting their meady, outrageous boasts,
  their heavy swords aswirl like eagles' wings. "Woe, woe, woe!" cries Hrothgar,
  hoary with winters, peeking in, wide-eyed, from his bedroom in back. His wife,
  looking in behind him, makes a scene. The thanes in the meadhall blow out the
  lights and cover the wide stone fireplace with shields. I laugh, crumple over; I
  can't help myself. In the darkness, I alone see clear as day. While they squeal
  and screech and bump into each other, I silently sack up my dead and withdraw
  to the woods. I eat and laugh and eat until I can barely walk, my chest-hair
  matted with dribbled blood, and then the roosters on the hill crow, and dawn
  comes over the roofs of the houses, and all at once I am filled with gloom again.<br><br>

   "This is some punishment sent us," I hear them bawling from the hill.  <br><br>
   My head aches. Morning nails my eyes.<br><br>
   "Some god is angry," I hear a woman keen. "The people of Scyld and
  Herogar and Hrothgar are mired in sin!"<br><br>
   My belly rumbles, sick on their sour meat. I crawl through bloodstained
  leaves to the eaves of the forest, and there peak out. The dogs fall silent at the
  edge of my spell, and where the king's hall surmounts the town, the blind old
  Shaper, harp clutched tight to his fragile chest, stares futilely down, straight at
  me. Otherwise nothing. Pigs root dully at the posts of a wooden fence. A
  rumple-horned ox lies chewing in dew and shade. A few men, lean, wearing
  animal skins, look up at the gables of the king's hall, or at the vultures circling
  casually beyond. Hrothgar says nothing, hoarfrost-bearded, his features cracked
  and crazed. Inside, I hear the people praying--whimpering, whining, mumbling,
  pleading--to their numerous sticks and stones. He doesn't go in. The king has
  lofty theories of his own.<br><br>

   "Theories," I whisper to the bloodstained ground. So the dragon once spoke.
  ("They'd map out roads through Hell with their crackpot theories!" I recall his
  laugh.) <br><br>
   Then the groaning and praying stop, and on the side of the hill the dirge-slow
  shoveling begins. They throw up a mound for the funeral pyre, for whatever
  arms or legs or heads my haste has left behind. Meanwhile, up in the shattered
  hall, the builders are hammering, replacing the door for (it must be) the fiftieth
  or sixtieth time, industrious and witless as worker ants--except that they make
  small, foolish changes, adding a few more iron pegs, more iron bands, with
  tireless dogmatism.<br><br>
   Now fire. A few little lizard tongues, then healthy flames reaching up
  through the tangled nest of sticks. (A feeble-minded crow could have fashioned
  a neater nest.) A severed leg swells up and bursts, then an arm, then another, and
  the red fire turns on the blackening flesh and makes it sizzle, and it reaches
  higher, up and up into greasy smoke, turning, turning like falcons at warplay,
  rushing like circling wolves up into the swallowing, indifferent sky. And now, by
  some lunatic theory, they throw on golden rings, old swords, and braided
  helmets. They wail, the whole crowd, women and men, a kind of song, like a
  single quavering voice. The song rings up like the greasy smoke and their faces
  shine with sweat and something that looks like joy. The song swells, pushes
  through woods and sky, and they're singing now as if by some lunatic theory
  they had won. I shake with rage. The red sun blinds me, churns up my belly to
  nausea, and the heat thrown out of the bone-fire burns my skin. I cringe, clawing
  my flesh, and flee for home.</P> -->
